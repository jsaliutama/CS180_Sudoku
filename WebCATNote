//----->Note of result from WebCAT:

Problem coverage: 71%

For this assignment, the proportion of the problem that is covered by your test cases is being assessed by running a suite of reference tests against your solution, and comparing the results of the reference tests against the results produced by your tests.

Differences in test results indicate that your code still contains bugs. Your code appears to cover only 71% of the behavior required for this assignment.

Your test cases are not detecting these defects, so your testing is incomplete--covering at most only 71% of the required behavior, possibly even less.

Double check that you have carefully followed all initial conditions requested in the assignment in setting up your solution, and that you have also met all requirements for a complete solution in the final state of your program.

The following hint(s) may help you locate some ways in which your solution and your testing may be improved:

testHiddenSingles(): (0,1) is wrong

isSolved(): The puzzle is not solved, but should be.

solve(): This simple puzzle should have been solved by the program.

board(): A "copy" of the board should have been returned, not the original.

Sudoku(int[][] board): The constructor did not copy the board
